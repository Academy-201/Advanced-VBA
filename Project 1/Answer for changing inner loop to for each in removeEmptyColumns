'**Below is my solution to this challenge. I have converted the inner for loop to a for each loop. **
Public Sub removeEmptyColumns()
Dim lCol As Long
Dim lRow As Long
Dim colNum As Long
'**This variable is not longer need. **
'Dim rowNum As Long
Dim anyData As Boolean

'** This are our new variables. **
Dim rowRng As Range
Dim cell As Variant

lRow = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
lCol = Cells(1, Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column

For colNum = lCol To 1 Step -1
    If Cells(1, colNum).Value = "" Then
        anyData = False
        '**The range of cells will have be calculated each time we find an empty header cell. **
        Set rowRng = Range(Cells(1, colNum), Cells(lRow, colNum))
        '**This is our new for each loop. **
        For Each cell In rowRng
            If cell <> "" Then
                 anyData = True
                Exit For
            End If
        Next cell
        
'        For rowNum = 1 To lRow
'            If Cells(rowNum, colNum).Value <> "" Then
'                anyData = True
'                Exit For
'            End If
'        Next rowNum
        If anyData = False Then
            Columns(colNum).EntireColumn.Delete
        End If
    End If
Next colNum

End Sub
